# React Native Highlight Words
React Native component used to highlight words within a larger body of text. This is a port of [react-highlight-words](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-highlight-words).

Check out a [demo](https://getexponent.com/@clauderic/react-native-highlight-words) using Exponent.

## Installation
Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-highlight-words):
```
npm i --save react-native-highlight-words
```

## Usage

To use it, just provide it with an array of search terms and a body of text to highlight:

```jsx
import Highlighter from 'react-native-highlight-words';

<Highlighter
  highlightStyle={{backgroundColor: 'yellow'}}
  searchWords={['and', 'or', 'the']}
  textToHighlight='The dog is chasing the cat. Or perhaps they're just playing?'
/>
```

And the `Highlighter` component will highlight all occurrences of search terms within the text:
